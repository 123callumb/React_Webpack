# React_Webpack
This is a template for out React Web App.

It has material-ui the library we talked about.
It is also running a webpack dev server, so we can compile the file when we load it up to our server.
It is running the latest versions of babel. Babel makes sure all the javascript code we write is compatible with all browsers/
