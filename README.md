# React_Webpack

This is a template for out React Web App.
It has material-ui the library we talked about.
It is also running a webpack dev server, so we can compile the file when we load it up to our server.
It is running the latest versions of babel. Babel makes sure all the javascript code we write is compatible with all browsers.

## SETUP

This template is for the people working on the front end to get used to react, material ui and fetching data. 
So once you have cloned the local repo to your computer. Make sure you have the latest version of node.js installed.
You can get that here: https://nodejs.org/en/
You want to open the repo folder in terminal/command prompt. I prefer to use an ide such as visual studio code which allows you to open the folder and open terminal/command prompt at that location.

Once you have the terminal/cmd open at the folder run the command 

```javascript
npm install
```
